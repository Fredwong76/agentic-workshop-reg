# Master Talk Track: The 30-Day MVP Introduction (Real Projects)

**Audience:** Sales & Presales Teams  
**Theme:** Career Upgrade & New Way of Working (NWOW)  
**Format:** Live "Conversation" Demo via Antigravity IDE

---

## 0:00 – 0:10 | The Velocity Gap
*   **Context:** The "One Month" Hook.
*   **The Narrative:** 
    *   Normally, setting up a GCP Landing Zone or building a candidate analysis tool would take weeks of coordination between developers and IT.
    *   "I delivered three distinct projects—an Instant GCP Demo with live cost tracking, an AI Interview Filter, and a SOW Automation tool—all in one month. Alone."
    *   **The Point:** This isn't about me being a 'super-coder'. It's about 'The System'. 
    *   **The Velocity Gap:** Companies stuck in the old way are paying 4x more and moving 4x slower.

## 0:10 – 0:25 | Case Study: The 30-Day Build (Storytelling)
*   **The Workflow:** Show how we moved from "I have an idea" to "I have a tool."
*   **Key Moments:**
    *   **GCP POC:** Rapidly configuring an 'Instant Demo' environment and querying live billing APIs to show 100% cost transparency. (Artifact 1)
    *   **Interviews:** Highlighting skill gaps and generating tough interview questions for candidates in seconds. (Artifact 2)
    *   **Cloud Assessment:** Transforming a 47-row Excel SOW into a technical design and a 4-point execution plan. (Artifact 3)
*   **Visual Aid:** Display `Conversation_Artifacts.md` (Artifact 1: Instant Demo & Cost).

## 0:25 – 0:40 | Live Demo: Conversations over Code
*   **Action:** Switch to Antigravity IDE. Hide all terminal/output windows.
*   **Demo Script:**
    1.  **Scene:** "Imagine a Sales lead walks in with a 50-page resume for a high-priority role. We need to know if this candidate fits the Band 7 JD *before* the customer call."
    2.  **Prompt:** *"Antigravity, I've got an interview with Eric Ho... give me 3 tough questions..."* (Refer to Artifact 2)
    3.  **The Reveal:** Show Antigravity identifying the "Zero Trust" gap and provide the questions.
    4.  **Bonus Demo (Live Costing):** *"Antigravity, what is our current MTD spend on the GCP POC?"* -> Show the response: **$0.17**. (Refer to Artifact 1)
    5.  **Concluding the Experience:** Show how this very workshop was fine-tuned live with the AI. (Refer to Artifact 4)

## 0:40 – 0:50 | The "Career Upgrade": Value Proposition
*   **For Sales Engineers/Presales:**
    *   **Instant Prototyping:** Build a SOW parser or a custom GCP POC for your customer in hours, not weeks.
    *   **Strategic Advantage:** You spend 10% of your time on "tools" and 90% on "strategy."
*   **For Sales:**
    *   **Margin Boost:** Lower delivery costs because we automate the "manual" parts of the technical lifecycle.
    *   **Modern Story:** We are the fastest, most AI-integrated team in the market.

## 0:50 – 1:00 | The NWOW Roadmap: Your Career Upgrade
*   **The Vision:** "Today was just a glimpse. Over the next six sessions, we are going to move you from being a **spectator** of this technology to being a **master architect** of it."
*   **Why You Must Attend (The 3 Keys):**
    1.  **From Magic to Mastery (Sessions 1 & 2):** We will move past 'generic prompts' and learn how to actually build end-to-end multi-language toolchains and data pipelines.
    2.  **Solve Your Real Problems (Session 3):** This isn't theoretical. Session 3 is a **Business Use Case Lab** where you will bring your own customer RFP or technical bottleneck and build a working prototype live.
    3.  **Governance & Safety (Session 4):** You’ll learn how to use these agents within the company's responsible AI framework, ensuring every solution we deliver is compliant, secure, and auditable.
*   **The Final Word:** "The distance between a brilliant idea and a billion-dollar solution has never been shorter. This workshop series is your roadmap to closing that gap. Step into the NWOW. Sign up for Session 1 today."
